						<h1>OneMain Financial Email Redesign</h1>
						<p>
							One of the first goals I had at OneMain, was to improve the email design structure, which was lacking consistency and brand recognition. The header and footer were not standardized, there were no guidelines for font usage, spacing, padding, body width, headlines, subheads, CTAs, etc. As a result, each email looked like it was coming from a different company.
						</p>
						<p>
							The objective of the redesign was to develop a cohesive set of templates that would be versatile enough to fit all subject matter needs, both solicitations and non-solicitation. We would need to solve for a variety of programs including rewards, account management, collections, social engagement, merchant referral, etc.

						<h4>Redesign Details</h4>
						<p>
							Based on the existing email criteria and categories, we tested in to 2 rounds of creative. For the first round we created 8 different individual templates that worked as a family of designs. The idea was that the project requestor could select a design from those options based on the criteria of the assignment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We took into consideration the need for images and icons for some marketing sends, and the need for copy only for others. We formated the header, footer, body width, text size and color, CTA treatment, social icon style, hyperlink treatment, etc. We implemented all new brand guidelines, and established consistency that the email platform was lacking.

						<h4>Templates</h4>
						<p>
							In the initial redesign, we used the straight across tagline logo lockup, centered on a white header. A hero image space was allotted for 4 of the designs, which would be used  primarily for solicitation emails. We provided 4 different hero image layouts, for icon use, non-icon use, additional information sections, and horizontal vs. vertical stacks. There were 2 designs dedicated to the Rewards Program, enrollment and engagement, and 2 text only templates designed for non-solicitation sends.
						</p>
						<p>
							Based on the test results from the preliminary set of designs, we shifted the templates into a second and final round of design. The tagline was dropped from the logo, we added more hierarchy definition to the type treatment, the body was differentiated by a narrower width than the hero image and a powder blue background, and social icons were changed to follow new CTA rules. We added an additional hero image design, and separated out the Rewards Program emails into their own category, adding a 3rd teamplate to the group.

						<h4>Mobile</h4>
						<p>
							The final templates were better optomized for mobile display, editing image and text size/orientation to scale responsively. The body section margins were dropped for mobile, but all other design details would appear consistent across all devices.
