						<h1>OneMain Financial Website Redesign</h1>
						<p>
							A short time after I started, I was responsible for overseeing the complete redesign of OneMainFinancial.com. The relationship with the development team stationed out of Chicago, was in a transitional state. They had been operating as a separate entity for a long time, and were newly aquired by OneMain when I joined the team. We had to begin by opening the doors of communication between our two teams, and then establish a working process.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once both teams were aligned, we began developing a road map for the site overhaul. Over a six month period of time, we would update the header and footer, restructure the layout of all main nav pages, and establish typography, grid, container, CTA and all other component styles.

						<h4>OMF.com Redesign</h4>
						<p>
							The original OneMainFinancial.com was missing key user centered design principles. The infomation was lacking a clearly defined heirarchy, which made it overwhelming and difficult to navigate. The structure was outdated, and inconsistent across pages. We wanted to carry over the values from the new brand platform; understanding our customer and helping them navigate the loan process, start to finish. So, a good digital experience was paramount to this. While also prioritizing the objectives of informing the customer, driving applications, and ultimately converting loans.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the initial redesign, we focused on the Homepage, Personal Loans, Why Us, Branch Search and Resources pages. I started by wireframing out a consistent layout, using a mobile first design strategy. Once the structure was in a good place, we implemented all new brand guidelines into the final visual designs. We also decided to officialy use the url OMF.com. I worked very closely with the dev team to adhere to all current platform requirements, and was completely hands on throughout the entire redesign process.						</p>

						<h4>Sketch Templates</h4>
						<p>
							We worked with a UX designer on the development team to build Sketch templates based on the approved new design layout, which would be used for all design development moving forward. The site would be built in a responsive framework, so the various break points were needed for initial reference.
						</p>
						<p>
							We defined a new grid system for each device template, text sizes, colors and alignment, container settings/styles, primary and secondary CTA styles, the new header and footer, and a variety of libraries for icon families, symbols, etc.

						<h4>Header/Footer</h4>
						<p>
							The redesign of the header and footer were an important first step to redefining the orgainizational structure and visual balance for the rest of the website.  Simplifying the color scheme, cleaning up the hierarchy of information and providing a more seamless user experience were the top priorities. We also updated the social icons to fit the new design direction, reworked CTA styles, and defined legal annotation rules.
