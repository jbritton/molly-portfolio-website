						<h1>Made on Main Street National Event</h1>
						<p>
							OneMain partnered with Main Street America to provide a grant program that supports the Main Street movement, the leading voice for community revitalization across the country. The mission was to provide the opportunity to renew the downtown areas of the selected winners and subsequently transform their economies, leverage local leadership, and improve overall quality of life. The grant program, alongside a celebratory event series, sought to bring lasting change and social offerings to the communities that OneMain serves.
						</p>
						<p>
							To celebrate the winning grants and their impact on their local communities, OneMain organized town festivals in 7 cities that brought the neighborhood together for a day of music and entertainment.

						<h4>Creative Details</h4>
						<p>
							I was asked to help craft an overarching design strategy that would reflect the initiatives of the Main Street mission and translate into a flexible visual aesthetic that could span multiple deliverables. Amara Waters, Creative Director of Copy, and I worked closely with the project manager to develop a system that fit the needs of the program but also felt relatable to our customers and residents of the towns where each event would be held.
						</p>
						<p>
							We wanted to align our brand with the partnership of Main Street America, so we decided our brand blue would be integrated throughout all event collateral. We also employed the artist who illustrated our initial brand icon set to create a logo for the event that represented main streets everywhere.
						</p>
						<p>
							We wanted to invoke the feeling of connecting people with each other and bringing a community together through the shared appreciation for breathing new life into the heart of their towns. The line treatment and background mapping detail was representative of the streets that connect them to one another and the neighborhood they all call home.

						<h4>Digital Presence</h4>
						<p>
							To help promote and provide details for each event we built individual landing pages hosted on omf.com for each cityâ€™s festival. We also leveraged our social platforms to encourage customer engagement and help drive traffic to the website. The homepage to the event provided insight into the value behind the project, which then linked off to city specific pages providing event specifics and FAQs.
						</p>
						<h4>Results</h4>
						<p>
							The results were overwhelmingly positive. With 7 events and 4.7k attendees, 72 local vendors were hired and 45 community groups engaged. The social reach exceeded 505k and media impressions totaled 357M. We were featured in the New York Times, CBS News, and The New York Business Journal to name a few.

						<h4>Branded Assets</h4>
						<p>
							After the initial design direction was established, my team built out all branded assets for the Made on Main Street events. Starting with promotional materials to build awareness of the festivals, including post cards sent to previous, existing and prospective customers, fliers handed out in local branches, street banners, posters displayed in local store fronts, direct mail advertisements and van wraps to build local hype.						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally we designed all of the materials for the day of the event, including booth activation tents, road and activity station signage, stage backdrops, photo booth backdrops, interactive murals, temporary tattoo stations, etc. We also designed all event giveaways including tees, balloons, pens/pencils, hats, bags, buttons, pennants and sunglasses.
